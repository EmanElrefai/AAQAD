## Introduction
We present the Alexu Arabic Question-Answer dataset (AAQAD), a new Arabic reading comprehension dataset consisting
of 17,000+ questions collected from a set of Wikipedia articles where the answer of the question is an extracted segment of text from the corresponding paragraph.
We present AAQAD Automatic Generator System, a Fully Automated data collector for our AAQAD, weâ€™ll discuss its algorithm later.
Also, this system is a Language Generic: The tool can be used to collect a specific dataset to any desired language from Wikipedia
articles just by a parameter modification to our tool. Our Automatic Generator algorithm is based on SQuAD, where we collect our
Arabic dataset from the same Wikipedia articles as SQuAD .
We applied the same models as SQuAD on our AAQAD : BERT and BIDAF model with 37 , 32 F1 respectively and applied cross
lingual BERT model.
