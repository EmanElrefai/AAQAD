Current Arabic Machine Reading for Question Answering datasets suffers from important shortcomings. The available datasets are
either small-sized high-quality collection or large-sized low-quality dataset. To address the aforementioned problem we present our
AlexU Arabic Question-Answer dataset (AAQAD). AAQAD is a new Arabic reading comprehension large-sized high-quality dataset
consisting of 17,000+ questions. To collect the AAQAD dataset, we present a fully automated data collector. Our collector works on a
set of Arabic Wikipedia articles for extractive question answering task. The chosen articles match the articles used in the well-known
SQuAD dataset. We provide evaluation results on the AAQAD dataset using two state-of-the-art models for machine-reading question
answering problems Namely, BERT and BIDAF models which result in 0.37 and 0.32 F-1 measure on AAQAD dataset.

## Project Description
The project is divided into 2 main phases:
### Data Collection
We implemented an automatic dataset generator system capapble of generating arabic dataset with question-answer pairs.
### Baseline Models
We plugged our dataset to known baseline models to evaluate some interesting results.
## Getting Started & Prerequisites
